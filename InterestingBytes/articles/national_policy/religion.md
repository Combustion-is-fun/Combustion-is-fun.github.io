# Religion and the state.
## How should they interact?
It is almost universally accepted that we need freedom of religion, belief and faith. However, we have terrorism and cults. This problem, irrational psychopaths abusing this liberty to cause death, destruction and fear, means that it is necessary to limit this liberty. Unfortunately, sometimes this has to be done through force via the state.
