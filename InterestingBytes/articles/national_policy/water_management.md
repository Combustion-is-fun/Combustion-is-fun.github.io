## Treating water
Treating water is hard and expensive because when it goes wrong people can get sick. Countries usually have great big treatment facilities run by corporations. These have money flowing in by overcharging their consumers thanks to the monopolies handed to them through Government regulation. 
On the one hand, we want the companies to be regulated so that we can control the quality of the water they provide through the taps. On the other hand, the regulation keeps bureaucratic corporations in monopolies by removing all competition or change of an entrepreneur to create a new water company. This means these companies drain the money out of your bank account. Leftists would state the solution is the state. A single nationalised water company synchronised to the "will of the people". This is equivalent to saying the solution to bureaucracy and monopolies is one giant bureaucracy and monopoly. This is not to mention run by the state, with the ability to put you in prison if you don't pay. This is obviously not going to work. We need more choice not less.

## A decentralised solution?
