# Taxation
## Legalised theft
Taxation is the state's plunder from its people using the threat of force if you do not pay up. There are many taxation systems and most countries use many as if they were collecting badges. They do this of course to hide the true amount they take from you. While there is no question that tax is a necessary component of a functioning society, it is not true that taxing people more makes a society function better. The question we should be asking is: how much should we tax people? As well as Who should we tax?

## Taxes have consequences
The wrong tax can cause a recession or collapse a society. Money also moves.







## Just like people don't like having money stolen, people don't like paying taxes.
### Money moves
It is easy to shout "Tax the Rich" but nobody ever got rich off of being an idiot (excluding celebrities, models film stars etc). People move to wherever treats them best and they take their money with them. This is especially true for the wealthy and it is easier for them to do so. Not to mention paying for very good accountants or simply bribing politicians to put loopholes into the tax codes. 

Big companies never pay huge amounts of tax. Worse case for them, it's passed onto the consumer. It's always the worker who believes "money doesn't grow on trees" who pays the tax. 

Tax is a cost. It makes business more risky. It acts as a disincentive for beneficial economic behaviours such as hiring new employees or even starting, investing in and growing a business. This is not good.
