## Software
You will soon realise that I am a fan on ProtonAG and the software they develop as well as Signal and the browsers I use.
### Messagers

#### Signal
Signal is in my opinion the best end-to-end encrypted messaging app. Well thats a big claim, what about Whatsapp? Well the thing is, Whatsapp is end-to-end encrypted, however being owned by the big tech giant meta, it is within the relm of possibility that a "backdoor" was coded in just for every wannabe tyrant in every state surveilance agency going.

### Email

## Hardware

### Phone and Tablet
There is no doubt in my mind that the solution for most people is android. Apple is not to be trusted on software and hardware. With collaberation with Governments and slow speeds, the Iphone is a flashy and expensive but not efficient or private way to call and text people. Whilst there are alternative (GrapheneOS, and linux phones), these are difficult to set up and or expensive. Thats why android phones are the best and most accessable for privacy.

### Laptop


### Personal Computer
