## Software
You will soon realise that I am a fan of ProtonAG and the software they develop as well as Signal and the browsers I use.
### Messager Apps

#### Signal
Signal is the best end-to-end encrypted messaging app. Well, that is a big claim, what about WhatsApp? Well, the thing is, Whatsapp is end-to-end encrypted, however, is owned by the big tech giant Meta, it is within the realm of possibility that a "backdoor" was coded in just for every wannabe tyrant in every state surveillance agency going.

## Hardware

### Phone and Tablet
There is no doubt in my mind that the solution for most people is Android. Apple is not to be trusted with software or hardware. With collaboration with Governments and slow speeds, the iPhone is a flashy and expensive but not efficient or private way to call and text people. While there are alternatives (GrapheneOS, and Linux phones), these are difficult to set up and or expensive. That's why Android phones are the best and most accessible for privacy.
