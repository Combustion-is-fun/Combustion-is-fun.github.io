## Software
You will soon realise that I am a fan of ProtonAG and the software they develop as well as Signal and the browsers I use.
### Messager Apps

#### Signal
Signal is the best end-to-end encrypted messaging app. Well, that is a big claim, what about WhatsApp? Well, the thing is, Whatsapp is end-to-end encrypted, however, is owned by the big tech giant Meta, it is within the realm of possibility that a "backdoor" was coded in just for every wannabe tyrant in every state surveillance agency going.

### Email

The Onion Router, commonly known as Tor.

## Hardware

### Phone and Tablet
There is no doubt in my mind that the solution for most people is Android. Apple is not to be trusted with software or hardware. With collaboration with Governments and slow speeds, the iPhone is a flashy and expensive but not efficient or private way to call and text people. While there are alternatives (GrapheneOS, and Linux phones), these are difficult to set up and or expensive. That's why Android phones are the best and most accessible for privacy. The aforementioned apps will assist with that endeavour. **Whatever you do, Do not buy a phone from a company from a tyrant state like China!**

### Laptop
A full Linux laptop wins the privacy battle obviously. However, there is a compromise between privacy and usability. Chromebooks with their safe but annoying non-download feature have a Linux virtual machine installed. This allows the installation of Linux apps and coding which is useful. ChromeOS itself is an upgraded version of Android, allowing you to install Apps (including the above ones) from the Google Play Store.

### Personal Computer
Here there is no excuse! privacy options are easy to get and relatively cheap. All the options are Linux-based. some are simple and easy like Ubuntu or Debian, and some are fun like RasberryPi. With the rise in web apps, there is absolutely no need for a Windows or Apple Mac. Not to mention your privacy cannot afford it.
